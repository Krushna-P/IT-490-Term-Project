How does the RabitMQ work ?
- It's a message broker that implement "AMQP" (Advansed Message Queuing Protocol) 
- Produer ---- exchange ------- queue ---- Consumer
- Produer send message to exchange, exchange forwards message to queue, and Consumer recieves message from queue.
- Produer have a routing key and exchange connect to queues by having binding key 
- To send a message the producer need to specify a routing key how an exchange compares the two keys depend on type of the exchange. 
- There are four different types of exchange:-
1. Fanout exchange - ignores the routing queue and send meassage to all the queues it knows about.
2. Direct exchange - it send the message where the routing key is the same as binding key
3. Topic exchange  - allows partial matches of keys
4. Header exchange - used message header instead of routing key
5. Default/Nameless exchange - compaires the routing key with the queue name and not the binding key
